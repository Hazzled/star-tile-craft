                If you're a homeowner anywhere from Beaverton to Gresham, you've probably noticed that our beloved PNW drizzle doesn't just water our gardens—it finds every crack and crevice in our homes. Cracked grout might seem like a minor cosmetic issue, but in Portland's consistently damp climate, it's actually a gateway for serious problems like mold, mildew, and structural damage.

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Understanding why grout cracks helps you prevent future problems and tackle the root cause, not just the symptoms. In the Portland metro area, several factors work together to stress your grout:

                  <ul className="space-y-3 text-lg">
                    <li><strong>Constant Humidity:</strong> Our year-round moisture levels cause grout to expand and contract repeatedly</li>
                    <li><strong>Temperature Fluctuations:</strong> From cool, wet winters to warm, dry summers, these cycles stress grout joints</li>
                    <li><strong>Poor Ventilation:</strong> Many Portland homes have limited bathroom ventilation, trapping moisture</li>
                    <li><strong>Age of Housing Stock:</strong> Many homes in neighborhoods like Laurelhurst and Irvington have older tile installations</li>

                Beyond climate, common causes include house settling (especially in areas with clay soil), improper initial installation, and simple wear and tear from daily use. The key is catching cracks early before water infiltration causes more serious damage.

                  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    This is the most critical step that many DIYers skip. Simply applying new grout over cracked grout is like putting a band-aid on a broken pipe—it won't hold in our damp climate.
                  </p>
                  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    Use a grout removal tool to carefully remove at least two-thirds of the old grout depth. In Portland's humidity, any remaining damaged grout will continue to deteriorate and compromise your repair. Work slowly to avoid damaging tiles.

                <div>
                  <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Step 2: Clean and Prepare</h3>
                  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    Vacuum out all loose grout particles and debris. Clean the area with a damp cloth and let it dry completely. This is especially important in bathroom settings where soap residue and mildew may be present.
                  </p>

                <div>

                  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    Follow manufacturer instructions exactly. For tile maintenance in the PNW, consider using grout with antimicrobial additives. Mix only what you can use in 20-30 minutes—Portland's humidity can affect working time.

                <div>

                  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    Using your grout float, work the grout into joints at a 45-degree angle. Press firmly to ensure complete filling. Remove excess grout immediately with the float edge, working diagonally across tiles.

                  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    Wait 15-20 minutes, then clean tiles with a slightly damp sponge. Rinse the sponge frequently in clean water. Shape grout lines with your finger or a grout tool for a professional finish.

                  <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Step 6: Cure and Seal (Critical for Portland Climate)</h3>
                  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    Allow grout to cure for 24-48 hours. In our Pacific Northwest humidity, proper curing is essential. Once cured, apply a high-quality grout sealer. This step is non-negotiable in Portland's wet climate—unsealed grout will crack again within months.
                  </p>
                  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                    Apply sealer according to manufacturer directions, typically requiring two coats. This creates a barrier against moisture infiltration that's absolutely essential for shower grout repair and bathroom tile maintenance in our region.
