              In Portland's perpetually damp climate, the difference between a bathroom remodel that lasts 5 years and one that lasts 25+ years comes down to one crucial step that many contractors skip: proper waterproofing behind your tile.

                Picture this: your brand-new tile shower looks absolutely stunning. The subway tiles are perfectly aligned, the grout lines are crisp, and you couldn't be happier with the investment. But here's the critical question every Portland homeowner should ask: <em>What's happening behind those beautiful tiles?</em>
              </p>
              
              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Here's a reality that surprises many homeowners: tile and grout are not waterproof. In fact, they're quite porous. Every time you shower, water penetrates through the grout and even through the tile body itself. In Portland's consistently humid environment, this water has nowhere to go—and that's where your problems begin.

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                The difference between a successful bathroom remodel in Gresham, Beaverton, or anywhere in the Portland metro area and a costly disaster isn't just the quality of the tile or the skill of the installer—it's whether proper waterproofing was installed before the first tile ever went up.

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                If you're planning a bathroom remodel in Portland, you're dealing with one of the most challenging climates in the country for tile installations. Our Pacific Northwest environment creates a perfect storm of conditions that make waterproofing absolutely non-negotiable:

                  <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">Why Portland's Climate is Tough on Tile</h3>
                  <ul className="space-y-3 text-lg">
                    <li><strong>Year-Round Humidity:</strong> Our outdoor humidity rarely drops below 60%, keeping moisture levels constantly high inside homes</li>
                    <li><strong>Limited Drying Time:</strong> Unlike drier climates where wet surfaces can dry quickly, Portland's humidity means moisture lingers</li>
                    <li><strong>Temperature Cycling:</strong> From cool, wet winters to warm summers, constant expansion and contraction stress building materials</li>
                    <li><strong>Poor Natural Ventilation:</strong> Our climate discourages opening windows, trapping moisture inside bathrooms</li>

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                In Arizona or Nevada, a poorly waterproofed shower might last years before problems become obvious—the dry climate helps mask water infiltration issues. But in Portland? You'll see mold, rot, and structural damage much faster. This is why PNW tile installation requires a higher standard of waterproofing than what might be acceptable elsewhere.
              </p>

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                The cost of cutting corners on waterproofing isn't just cosmetic. Water damage behind tile can lead to structural rot, toxic mold growth, and the need to completely tear out and rebuild your bathroom—often costing three times what the original remodel cost.

                Before diving into proper waterproofing methods, let's address some dangerous misconceptions that lead to failed tile installations throughout the Portland area. These myths have cost homeowners from Hillsboro to Gresham thousands of dollars in remediation costs.

                    </h3>
                    <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                      <strong>The Reality:</strong> Cement backer board (like Hardiebacker or Durock) is water-stable, meaning it won't fall apart when wet. But it's absolutely not waterproof. Water passes right through it, and in Portland's humid climate, that water will sit against your framing and cause rot.

                    <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                      Cement board is an excellent substrate for tile, but it must be properly waterproofed with a membrane system before tile installation.

                    <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                      <strong>The Reality:</strong> Grout sealer is designed for stain resistance, not waterproofing. Even the best grout sealer will allow water penetration, and it requires regular reapplication. Relying solely on grout sealer for waterproofing is like using an umbrella with holes in it.

                    <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                      Professional waterproofing creates a continuous barrier behind the tile that doesn't rely on grout joints or surface treatments.

                      <strong>The Reality:</strong> Green board (moisture-resistant drywall) was never intended for direct water exposure in shower areas. In Portland's bathroom remodel projects, we still see contractors using green board in showers, which is a recipe for disaster.

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Proper waterproofing typically adds 10-15% to the cost of a tile installation project. For a typical Portland bathroom remodel, this might mean an additional $800-1,500. That might seem significant until you consider the alternative.

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Water damage remediation in the Pacific Northwest typically costs $15,000-30,000 for a single bathroom, including tear-out, structural repairs, mold remediation, and complete reinstallation. Beyond the financial cost, there's the disruption to your family, the stress of dealing with water damage, and the health concerns that come with mold growth.
              </p>

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                When viewed in this context, professional waterproofing isn't just a good idea—it's the most cost-effective insurance policy you can buy for your bathroom remodel. In Portland's challenging climate, it's not a question of if water will find a way behind improperly protected tile, but when.
