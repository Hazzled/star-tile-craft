              Portland's design scene continues to evolve, and 2025 brings exciting new tile trends that perfectly capture the city's unique blend of urban sophistication and Pacific Northwest charm.

            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-foreground leading-relaxed mb-6">

                <p className="text-foreground mb-4">
                  Ceramic tiles remain the backbone of Portland home design, but 2025 sees them elevated with sophisticated finishes and innovative manufacturing techniques. Modern ceramic tiles now offer incredible texture variations and color depth that rivals natural materials at a fraction of the cost.
                </p>
                <p className="text-foreground mb-4">
                  Portland homeowners are particularly drawn to ceramic tiles with matte finishes that complement the city's industrial heritage and contemporary aesthetic. These tiles work beautifully in both urban lofts and traditional homes, offering durability that withstands Portland's occasional moisture while maintaining their beauty year after year.

                <p className="text-foreground mb-4">
                  Porcelain tiles have become the gold standard for Portland homes in 2025, and for good reason. Their exceptional durability and water resistance make them ideal for our Pacific Northwest climate, while technological advances now allow porcelain to perfectly mimic natural materials like wood, stone, and even fabric.
                </p>
                <p className="text-foreground mb-4">
                  The latest trend we're seeing in Portland homes is wood-look porcelain planks that capture the warmth of hardwood without the maintenance concerns. These tiles are particularly popular in kitchen and dining areas where homeowners want the cozy feel of wood with the practicality of tile.
                </p>

                  Natural stone continues to resonate strongly with Portland's connection to the outdoors. In 2025, we're seeing a shift toward locally-sourced and sustainable stone options that reflect the region's commitment to environmental consciousness. Travertine, limestone, and slate are particularly popular choices that bring the beauty of the Oregon landscape indoors.
                </p>
                <p className="text-foreground mb-4">
                  Portland homeowners are increasingly choosing honed finishes over polished surfaces, appreciating the more subtle, organic feel that complements the city's laid-back sophistication. These materials work exceptionally well in bathroom applications and as accent walls that create focal points without overwhelming the space.

              <p className="text-foreground mb-4">
                While traditional 3x6 subway tiles remain beloved in Portland homes, 2025 brings exciting variations that breathe new life into this classic format. Larger subway tiles in 4x12 and 6x24 sizes are creating more contemporary looks, while colored grout is being used to create contrast and visual interest.
              </p>
              <p className="text-foreground mb-6">
                Portland designers are also experimenting with vertical installations and stacked patterns rather than the traditional brick layout, creating height and modern sophistication in kitchen backsplashes and bathroom walls.
              </p>
            </div>

            {/* Hexagon Patterns */}

              <p className="text-foreground mb-4">
                Hexagonal tiles have found their perfect home in Portland's design-conscious community. These geometric shapes add visual interest without being overwhelming, making them ideal for both subtle accent areas and bold statement walls. We're seeing them used extensively in bathroom floors and kitchen backsplashes where their honeycomb pattern creates organic movement.
              </p>
              <p className="text-foreground mb-6">
                The trend toward larger hexagons (4-6 inches) provides a more contemporary feel while smaller versions create intricate, jewel-like patterns that Portland homeowners love for powder rooms and accent areas.

              </div>
              <p className="text-foreground mb-4">
                Large format tiles (24x24 inches and larger) are revolutionizing Portland home design by creating seamless, uninterrupted surfaces that make spaces feel larger and more luxurious. These tiles work particularly well in Portland's often compact urban homes where maximizing the perception of space is crucial.
              </p>
              <p className="text-foreground mb-6">
                The minimal grout lines create cleaner, more contemporary looks while also being easier to maintain – a practical benefit that busy Portland professionals appreciate. We're installing these primarily in bathrooms and kitchen floors where their impact is most dramatic.

                  Portland homeowners consistently prioritize environmentally conscious choices, and tile selection is no exception. In 2025, we're seeing increased demand for recycled content tiles, locally-sourced materials, and manufacturers with sustainable production practices.

                <p className="text-foreground mb-6">
                  This environmental consciousness doesn't mean compromising on style. Many eco-friendly tiles now offer cutting-edge designs and finishes that rival traditional options while supporting Portland's commitment to sustainable living.
